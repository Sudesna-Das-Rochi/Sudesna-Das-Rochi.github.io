I have selected the following dataset from the awesome-datascience GitHub: https://github.com/datasets/covid-19 \

This dataset contains the number of people infected, those who have died, and those who have recovered from COVID-19 over time, from 2020 to 2022, for various countries. The dataset is regularly updated with information on people affected by infections in different countries. This dataset provides valuable and meaningful insights and has potential applications. Anyone can get knowledge on how the virus spreads over time. As Covid 19 spreads by air, we can have an idea from the dataset, which countries are prone to be affected more by their geographical conditions by the airborne infections. From the number of deaths, we can have an idea of the immunity condition of people of different countries against any infection. As there is a regular update on the datasets, we can find out the relation between the virus and weather as well. The datasets can be used to understand wave patterns and predict future outbreaks. By analyzing the data, we will be able to characterize the spread of similar diseases like COVID-19.
