#Dataset:
I have selected the following dataset from the awesome-datascience GitHub: [Covid-19 Dataset](https://github.com/datasets/covid-19/)

This dataset contains the number of people infected, those who have died, and those who have recovered from COVID-19 over time, from 2020 to 2022, for various countries. The dataset is regularly updated with information on people affected by infections in different countries. This dataset provides valuable and meaningful insights and has potential applications. Anyone can get knowledge on how the virus spreads over time. As Covid 19 spreads by air, we can have an idea from the dataset, which countries are prone to be affected more by their geographical conditions by the airborne infections. From the number of deaths, we can have an idea of the immunity condition of people of different countries against any infection. As there is a regular update on the datasets, we can find out the relation between the virus and weather as well. The datasets can be used to understand wave patterns and predict future outbreaks. By analyzing the data, we will be able to characterize the spread of similar diseases like COVID-19.

#Book
I have selected the following book from free-data-science-book: [Introduction to R](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.pdf)

Author name: W. N. Venables, D. M. Smith, and the R Core Team

The book named “An Introduction to R” is written for beginners who are working on data-related programs and need software for advanced analysis of the dataset. This book provides a foundation for R tool and its applications. This book contains basic concepts like vectors, arrays, index matrices, data frames, etc. This book introduces programming features for data import, reading data from files, statistical computing, graphical visualization, and many more. I am interested in this book because I have taken Big Data Science and Analytics Platforms and Time Series Analysis for Business Forecasting courses, and I am going to use R in both courses. I need to learn basic concepts and the fundamentals related to R. Through this book, I will be able to get familiar with the tool and make the best use of it.
